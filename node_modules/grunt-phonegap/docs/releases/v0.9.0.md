#### v0.9.0

A large amount of code has been refactored, which may have introduced new bugs. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/issues)
if a feature no longer works with your `v0.8.1` config.

* Adds support for remote builds using the [Phonegap Build](https://build.phonegap.com) service ([#31](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/issues/31))
* Refactors tasks source into feature-specific files ([#28](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/issues/28))
