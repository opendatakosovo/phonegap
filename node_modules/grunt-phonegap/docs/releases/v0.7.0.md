#### v0.7.0

The icon configuration API has changed to permit multiple platforms. If you
used this feature before `v0.7.0`, please update your **Gruntfile** as per
the updated example in `README.md`.

  * Adds app icon management for Windows Phone 8 (thanks [@kombucha](https://github.com/kombucha))
  * FIX: Cordova hook file permissions are now preserved (#13)
  * FIX: Release keystore file path can lead to unexpected escaped characters (Windows) (#15)
  * FIX: No longer inadvertantly attempt a device deploy instead of an emulator deploy when the
    emulator option is passed to `phonegap:run` (#17)
  * Reorganizes tests into an improved file structure based on platforms and features
  * Removes indirect references to Grunt's deprecated external (lodash & async) libraries
  * Updates devDependencies `grunt-contrib-coffee`, `grunt-contrib-copy` and `grunt-bump` to their latest versions.
