#### v0.12.0

If you have local plugins specified as relative paths from `phonegap.config.path`,
you will need to change those paths - see [#56](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/pull/56) for details.

* Adds feature: set <application android:name> attribute from grunt-phonegap config
* Fixes an issue which causes user grunt configuration to be lost during release task
* Resolve absolute plugin paths for local filesystem
