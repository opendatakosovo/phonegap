#### v0.9.2

* Adds support for iOS icons (thanks [gabrielpoca](https://github.com/gabrielpoca)!)
* Fixes regression ([#43](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/issues/43)) (Android install fails when optional property config.versionCode is omitted)
* Splits `README.md` into multiple source files listed under `docs/`, as it was becoming large and unwieldy.
* Updates `grunt-contrib-coffee`
