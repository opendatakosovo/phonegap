#### v0.15.0

* Replaces [directory-copy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/directory-copy) with [ncp](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ncp) for better handling of directories with many files (thanks [@jrvidal](https://github.com/jrvidal)!) [#88](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/pull/88)
* Adds the option to use any html file as your index.html (thanks [@pdelorme](https://github.com/pdelorme)!) [#89](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/pull/89)
* Adds missing commas to the README (merged in a previous version but clobbered inadvertantly) (thanks again [@Odi55555](https://github.com/Odi55555)!)
