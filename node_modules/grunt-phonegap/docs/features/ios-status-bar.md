When 'phonegap.config.iosStatusBar' is set to 'WhiteAndTransparent' the APP_NAME-Info.plist is updated to white text and transparent background,adding the following configuration:

    "Status bar style" = "Transparent black style (alpha of 0.5)"
    "View controller-based status bar appearance" = "NO"

Works only for iOS7.
